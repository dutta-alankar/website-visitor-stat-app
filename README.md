# website-visitor-stat-app
A Flask server app which tracks visitor IP location and updates unique visitor count that can be integrated in a website.

I have also provided a sample html client that can be modified and used in any webpage. The client also puts the geo-coordinates of the unique visitors on the map in a dynamic webpage. 
Make sure to change the `serverAddress` in the html javascript of the client to point to your server. 
`statserver.py` is the Flask server code that I'm using. I have hosted my server in ![https://www.pythonanywhere.com/](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). 
You can choose whatever suits you. 

To run the server, install all the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
